Name: Emily Quigley
Project: Assignment 1, Portfolio
Due Date: 2/6/2014

1. This project is a portfolio (index.html) that links to a personal bio (bio.html) and resume (resume.html). Both index.html and bio.html are the content files that utilize the index.css stylesheet, and the resume.html has its own CSS stylesheet (resume.css). During this project, I was able to implement the link of the html/css files correctly the first time around. I had difficulty implementing classes, but eventually was able to figure it out after trying a few different sequences of ordering things in my code.
2. I did not collaborate with ay students on this project specifically, but Gabriel Joseph (c/o '15') helped me understand how div backgrounds worked.
3. I spent about 8 hours total on this assignment (2 hours/4 days).
