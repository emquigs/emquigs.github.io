			<p> Emily is a junior at Tufts University, majoring in International Relations and minoring in Computer Science. She is passionate about anything having to do with people, coffee, new places, and/or the outdoors. When she is not outside exploring, she is inside trying to stay warm and adapt to Boston winters. Her hobbies include hammocking, miming, tennis-ing, climbing mountains, movie-quoting and hanging out on roofs. You can usually find her singing to Paul Simon at the Rez Cafe, where she works/lives.
