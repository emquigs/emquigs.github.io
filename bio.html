		<p> Emily is an junior International Relations major, Computer Science minor from South Florida who is passionate about anything having to do with people, coffee, new places, and/or coding. When she is not outside exploring, she is inside trying to stay warm and adapt to Boston winters. Her hobbies include hammocking, reading, tennis-ing, climbing mountains, and hanging out on roofs. You can usually find her singing BeeGees songs at the Rez Cafe, where she works/lives.
