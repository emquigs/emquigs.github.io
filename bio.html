	<p> Quigs is a junior who is technically majoring in International Relations but is more accurately undecided. When she is not outside exploring, she is inside trying to bring circulation back into her fingers that have a tendency to turn into sausages when the temperature falls below 40 degrees. Did she mention sheâ€™s from Florida? Her hobbies include hammocking, reading, tennis-ing, and hanging out on roofs (after all, they are the best places for sunset-watching). She has compiled a list of best roofs in the Tufts campus area so if you would like to add your roof to the list, or chat about anything else, you can find her singing BeeGees songs at the Rez.</p>
