	<p> Emily (aka Quigs) is an International Relations major, Computer Science minor from South Florida. When she is not outside exploring, she is inside trying to stay warm and adapt to Boston winters. Her hobbies include hammocking, reading, tennis-ing, and hanging out on roofs. She has compiled a list of best roofs in the Tufts campus area so if you would like to add your roof to the list, or chat about anything else, you can usually find her singing BeeGees songs at the Rez. </p>
